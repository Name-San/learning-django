6:40 | Building Restful APIs 
- A way to communicate between clien and server.
- Restful defines the following of these concept
- Resource, Representation, HTTP methods

9:15 | Resources
- Resources can be objects and can be accessed through a URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
- use two level in creating url pattern
- one of characteristic in resfut api is a easy to follow url

10:45 | Resource Representation
-  When accessing a url it return a representation, it can be HTML, XML, or JSON
- any representation can be return, but if your api supports all representation then it is better to make the client identify the format it needs.

12:54 | HTTP Methods
- Is  a way of identifying the purpose of the endpoint the client access.
- it can be GET for getting resourse, POST for creating a resoure, PUT for updating a resource, PATCH updating certain part of  the resource, DELETE for deleting resource. 
- POST needs a body
- PUT is updating everthing of the object, PATCH for a part of object only. this also need body
- DELETE does not need a body

 14:58 | Installing Django REST Framework
- install djangorestframework
- add in installed, rest_framework

15:56 | Creating API Views
- user the usual way of accessing a ur pattern, with declaring a urlpattern then create a correspond httprespone
- using rest_framework from django, we have to import first
- from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, this will be added as decorator in the function view,
- next, from rest_framework.response import Response, and we will use these response method to return a response.

24:04 | Creating Serializers
- Serializers is for converting a python object into JSON format, which is standard of returning a representation from an api call
- in order to create serializers:
- first we were create a serializers.py
- import the serializers from rest_framework
- and create a class inheriting the serializers.Serializer model
- so when adding a attributes, is quite the same when how we creating a attribute for a database model
 
28:08 | Serializing objects
- 

34:23 | Creating Custom Serializer Field
- you can create custom field by using the serializer.method field to add method_name arguments and passing the def method within the class which handles the data that will be return

38:53 | Serializing Relationship
- by defining default, serializers.relatedfield methods you can specify diffent relationship to be converted
- can be string, primarykey, nested, hyperlink

47:43 | Model Serializer
- inherit the ModelSerializer class
- Using Meta class, you can defined the fields, and specify the target model
- add the necessary fields that will be converted in JSON

52:36 | Deserializing Objects
- Use the design Serializer class, then add data arguments equal to the request.data
- the retuurn can be access using the variable.validated_data

55:09 | Data Validation
- serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True)
- override validation in the model class by defining a validated method passing self and data - dictionary type, then return error or the data.

1:00 | Saving Objects
- use the .save() method,
- you can override the create() and update() method in the base class to align with your objective
- but django will automaticall handle the appropriate method
- 

1:08 | Deleting Objects
- used delete()

1:17 | Advance API Concepts
- import APIView from Views
- add corresponding method on each httpmethod you want to use.  

1:22 | Mixins

1:26 | Generic Views
- import from generic in rest Framework

1:33 | Customizing Views
- import mixins and generic Views

1:38 | ViewSets 
- In creating viewset, you first analyze the repeating pattern within your APIView.
- You can import the ModelViewset from the rest_framework viewset
- in inherite the 4 mixins and in that way it works exact the same with other APIView.
- The difference is, now you're combining the related function or api in related to certain database model.

1:42 | Router
- import router from rest_framework, can be simple router or default router
- instantiate then register with prefix and the model viewset
- access through router.urls
- add to urlpatterns

1:52 | Building the Reviews API 

1:56 | Nested Routers
- used the drf-nested-routers package
- import routers from rest_framework_nested
- since the routers have already DefaultRouter and SimpleRouter, we will use those for declaring our router
- instantiate NestedRouter, add necessary arguments, then register a new router as nested with it.

2:06 | Filtering
- to filter the list from api, we have to modify the url by adding parameters
- to access parameters in the url, we have to use the self.reques.query_params
- modify the queryset to return the correct query based on the passed parameter

2:11 | Generic Filtering
- instead of manually overriding the get_queryset and define your filters, there is a package where you can use to easily filter the queryset based on the url
- django-filter
- from django_filter.rest_framework import DjangoFilterBackend
- inside the viewset, define the filter_backends in array with the import
- define filterset_fields with array values, or
- filerset_class by creating a class inheriting the FilterSet from the same location
- and Meta method, define the target model and fields with a dictionary values, data field as the key, and value as the expression in an array.
- now you no longer need the get_queryset method_name

2:17 | Searching 
- we can user searching filter by importing it from rest_framework.filter
- include it the filter_backends
- then add search_fields attribute with array values

2:20 | Sorting
- same with searching import OrderingFilter in the same module, then
- add ordering_fields with array values

2:21 | Pagination
- first import pagenumberpagination from rest_framework.Pagination
- then add pagination_class attribute equal to the pagenumber pagination_class
- to add pagination globally, we can it in settings.py with DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS, then PAGE_SIZE.
- we can also create a custom class to specifically add the page_size to the target viewset only

2:27 | Buiding Shopping Cart API

2:39 | Creating a Cart

2:44 | Getting a Cart   

2:53 | Deleting a Cart

2:55 | Creating Cart Items

3:00 | Adding Cart Item
- 

3:12 | Updating Cart Item
- http_method_names = ['get', 'post', 'patch', 'delete']

3:14 | Deleting Cart Items

3:15 | Djnango Authentication System

3:21 | Extending the User Model

3:32 | Creating User Profile

3:39 | Groups and Permission

3:42 | Creating Custom Permissions

3:44 | Securing APIs

3:46 | Adding Authentication Endpoints
- using Djoser as the API Layer and JWT as the auth engine

3:52 | Registering Users
- as much as possible ke separate endpoints base on their functionalities,
- in that way, it is manageable and reusable
- inherit the serializer from djoser, to create a customize fields

4:02 | Building the Profile API
- build api for customer 

4:07 | Logging In

4:21 | Current User Profile
- define actions is a viewset

4:28 | Applying permissions
- using the rest_framework.permissions, you add permissions on the viewset by using the attribute: permission_classes wath value list,
- you also defin an attribute of permission_classes in the action decorator.
- In complex permissions, you can used get permission method to return permission based on the request method.
- make sure to return a list of the permission class instance
- you can add global permission in settings, using the DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES

4:33 | Custom Permissions
- user the Base permission from the rest_framework
- override the has_permission method to return your specific boolean value
- you can also user DjangoModelPermission in which it uses the permission built in the admin panel and apply this permission
- in the api

4:44 | Applying Custom Permissions 

4:49 | Designing Order API
- CQS - Command Query Separation

5:03 | Creating Order
- in the base serializer, we override save() to create an Order base on ther user id from the viewset passed through context
- we can access request() from the serializer, but in the viewset only.
- so we identify the customer user the request.user.id and create an order based on these customer

5:08 | Creating Order Items
- we modify the save() and add in that method we creat cart items   
- filter the cart item query to return only the corresponding cart_id which git from the validated_data of the serializer
- using a list comphrehension and bulk_create we manage to create items for the order
